# techo-leagues

There are three parts to this exercise

First create unit tests to cover all code in LeagueService.java following TDD methodology.  Write tests first, then code.
Branch - git checkout -b feature/league-service/display-league/[your jira ticket here ex: tp-23]

Second, Your job is to get this application to a working state.  It has all sorts of errors so you will have to research not only its logic but also supporting services, like Config server, OAuth, Eureka...
Branch - git checkout -b fix/workspace/[your name here]

Third create a PCF service broker from the hashmap exercise you have submitted for your assessment.
Branch - git checkout -b feature/servicebroker/[your name here]

For each of these exercises please create a separate branch, you should have three branches at the end and create three separate pull requests.
