# techo-leagues

There are three parts to this exercise

First create unit tests to cover all code in LeagueService.java following TDD methodology.  Write tests first, then code.

Second, Your job is to get this application to a working state.  It has all sorts of errors so you will have to research not only its logic but also supporting services, like Config server, OAuth, Eureka...

Third create a PCF service broker from the hashmap exercise you have submitted for your assessment.

For each of these exercises please create a separate branch, you should have three branches at the end and create three separate pull requests.
